# ByteRank

A platform for solo developers to compete with each other on coding consistency. Track your commits, join teams, and stay motivated by competing with others.

## About

ByteRank helps developers build and maintain coding habits by gamifying consistency. Create or join teams, track your daily contributions, and see how you rank against other developers.

I'm still working on it and not 100% sure what type of features I'll add but hopefully LeetCode integration and possibly a Discord bot version

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with App Router, React, TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
